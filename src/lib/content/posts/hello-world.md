# Hello, world!

What's going on around here?  
Well, I'm just starting my blog, something that I've been procrastinating for... 7 years...?  
So, I'm pretty much excited about it!  

Also, it looks very scrappy.  
I'm really taking the opportunity to do something nice with SvelteKit, so it's gonna take a while to make it pretty - I'd imagine.  
But I want to build in public.  

BTW many thanks to Josh Collinsworth for [having shared his blog](https://joshcollinsworth.com/blog/build-static-sveltekit-markdown-blog) with the world.  
This project is pretty much based on his work.
