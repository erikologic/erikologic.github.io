# Some ideas

## Tech

### HC and alarms

- span can be raised from different locations (uncouple)
- frame the alarm positively (monitor success instead of failures)
- ...but you need to monitor for unknowns as well
- use distributed tracing and relational fields - one dataset limitations for triggers
- use fancy derived column + queries (minestrone stuff)

### Adapters and O11y

### Testing levels

- mention serverless test patterns!
