### HC and alarms

- span can be raised from different locations (uncouple)
- frame the alarm positively (monitor success instead of failures)

- use distributed tracing and relational fields - one dataset limitations for triggers
- use fancy derived column + queries (minestrone stuff)

### Adapters and O11y

### Testing levels

- mention serverless test patterns!

### Telling an observable story

- use logging and tracing for tracking the story of your app

### How we became a DORA elite team
